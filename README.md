Dotfiles @criemen
=================

A simple set of dotfiles, based on [dotbot]: https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot.

To keep submodules at their proper versions, you could include something like
`git submodule update --init --recursive` in your `install.conf.yaml`.

To upgrade your submodules to their latest versions, you could periodically run
`git submodule update --init --remote`.
